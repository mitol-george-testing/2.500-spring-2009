Homework 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_500s09_hw02))

Homework 4 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_500s09_hw04))

Term Project
------------

Problem Statement ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_500s09_project)) - This describes conditions in Phaeton and Paulette, including the results of field tests of several water supplies in the villages. It also sets out the requirements for the term project.

Map of Cap Haitien ([KML]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/haiti)) - Download this file to explore in Google Earth, or copy the URL into [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/).

Q&A ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_500s09_questions)) - These are answers to some student questions by Amy Smith and Kofi Taha.

Phaeton & Paulette Water Testing ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_500s09_testing01)) - Test results for Phaeton and Paulette, Haiti. We believe that these may refer to the diesel pumped supply, not the ground water.

Phaeton Family Well Testing ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_500s09_testing02)) - Test results for the water sample collected from a hand-dug well in Phaeton during March 2009. They also include results for Sous Sale Bay and Pestel Harbor.
